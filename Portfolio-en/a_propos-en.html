                    <p>My name is Lukas Gendrot, and I'm an IT technician trainee in a 2-year course (BTS SIO option SISR) specialized in networks.</p>

                    <h2>My journey</h2>
                    <p>I've always been ambitious and that's why, at the end of my second year of high school, in order to continue learning more about computer sciences, I changed high school so that I could take a course specialized in digital technologies and computer sciences (NSI).</p>

                    <h2>My commitment</h2>
                    <p>At the same time as my schooling, I've been a volunteer fireman since my final year of high school. This activity has enabled me to put things into perspective. This dual status is not always easy to manage, but having always been a volunteer, it was logical for me to continue my commitment after 4 years as a young firefighter (JSP).</p>
